        <h2>What Is Inheritance Tax?</h2>
        <p>Inheritance tax (IHT) is a tax imposed on the estate of a deceased individual. The tax is levied on the total value of assets and possessions left behind, including property, money, investments, and personal belongings. In the UK, inheritance tax is primarily governed by the Inheritance Tax Act 1984.</p>

        <h2>Who Pays Inheritance Tax?</h2>
        <p>Inheritance tax is typically paid by the executor or administrator of the deceased person's estate. However, it's essential to understand who is subject to this tax:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>The Deceased's Estate: The estate of the deceased person is responsible for paying inheritance tax. This includes all assets, property, and possessions owned by the deceased at the time of their death.</li>
            <li>Beneficiaries: Inheritance tax is indirectly paid by the beneficiaries of the estate. If the estate is subject to inheritance tax, it reduces the overall value of the assets passed on to heirs.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Inheritance Tax Thresholds</h2>
        <p>In the UK, inheritance tax is not levied on all estates. There are specific thresholds and exemptions to consider:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Nil-Rate Band: Every individual is entitled to a tax-free allowance called the "nil-rate band." As of the 2022/2023 tax year, the nil-rate band is set at £325,000.</li>
            <li>Residence Nil-Rate Band (RNRB): In addition to the nil-rate band, there is the residence nil-rate band, which applies when a family home is passed to a direct descendant (e.g., children or grandchildren). The RNRB for the 2022/2023 tax year is £175,000.</li>
            <li>Total Allowance: For a married couple or civil partners, the total allowance combining the nil-rate band and RNRB can reach £1 million if specific criteria are met.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>How Is Inheritance Tax Calculated?</h2>
        <p>Inheritance tax is calculated as a percentage of the taxable estate value exceeding the available thresholds and allowances. The standard inheritance tax rate is 40%, but it can be reduced to 36% if at least 10% of the estate's net value is left to charity.</p>
        <p>Here's a simplified formula to calculate inheritance tax:</p>
        <p>Taxable Estate Value - (Nil-Rate Band + RNRB + Other Deductions) x Tax Rate = Inheritance Tax Owed</p>

        <h2>Strategies to Mitigate Inheritance Tax</h2>
        <p>There are legal methods to reduce or eliminate the impact of inheritance tax. These include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Lifetime Gifts: Gifting assets to beneficiaries during your lifetime can reduce the taxable value of your estate.</li>
            <li>Tax-Efficient Wills: Careful estate planning and drafting of wills can help minimize inheritance tax liabilities.</li>
            <li>Trusts: Setting up trusts can protect assets from inheritance tax.</li>
            <li>Agricultural or Business Relief: Certain assets, like farmland or business assets, may qualify for relief, reducing their taxable value.</li>
            <li>Charitable Donations: Leaving assets to charity can reduce the overall inheritance tax rate.</li>
            <li>Life Insurance: Some policies can cover the cost of inheritance tax.</li>
            <li>Professional Advice: Seek advice from financial advisors and estate planners to create a tax-efficient plan.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>Inheritance tax in the UK is a tax levied on the estate of a deceased person. It's essential to understand the thresholds, allowances, and potential strategies to mitigate its impact. Effective estate planning can help ensure that your assets are passed on to your loved ones as efficiently as possible while minimizing tax liabilities.</p>
